# hello-world

Hello! I'm Georgia, a multidisciplinary designer based in Sydney.  I have a keen interest in branding, print design (whoever said 'print is dead' is a terrible liar) and digital marketing. I enjoy designing for social impact, travel photography and hand-lettering. I am currently in the process of teaching myself to code via freeCodeCamp - eeep!
